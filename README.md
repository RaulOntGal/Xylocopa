# Xylocopa Phylogeny Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the phylogeny of the genus *Xylocopa*. The workflow includes:

- Download genetic sequences for *Xylocopa* from BOLD and NCBI.
- Clean and standardize the data (FASTA format, remove duplicates, remove empty sequences).
- Separate sequences by species.
- Generate consensus sequences for each species.
- Align sequences and build gene trees.
